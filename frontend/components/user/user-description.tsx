      Hi everyone, my name is IU. My youtube channel is
      https://www.youtube.com/IU. I will build the IU Keyboard in Q4 2022! Carla
      Bruni sings: See the pyramids along the Nile. Watch the sun rise on a
      tropic isle. Just remember, darling, all the while. You belong to me. See
      the marketplace in old Algiers. Send me photographs and souvenirs. Just
      remember when a dream appears. You belong to me. I'll be so alone without
      you. Maybe you'll be lonesome too, and blue. Fly the ocean in a silver
      plane. See the jungle when it's wet with rain. Just remember till you're
      home again. You belong to me. I'll be so alone without you. Maybe you'll
      be lonesome too, and blue. Fly the ocean in a silver plane. Watch the
      jungle when it's wet with rain. But remember darling, till you're home
      again. You belong to me.
